## Introduction to DocuBook Components

DocuBook provides a robust set of components that enable developers to build dynamic, user-friendly, and visually appealing documentation. These components are designed to enhance the user experience, making it easier for readers to navigate, understand, and interact with the content.

In this guide, weâ€™ll explore the core components available in DocuBook and how you can integrate them into your documentation projects. For a complete list of components, visit the [official documentation](https://www.docubook.pro/docs/getting-started/components).

## Key Components and Their Usage

### 1. **Accordion**

The Accordion component is perfect for organizing content into collapsible sections. This is particularly useful for FAQs, detailed guides, or step-by-step tutorials.

#### Example:

```mdx
<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="What is DocuBook?">
    DocuBook is a modern platform for creating interactive and dynamic
    documentation.
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="How do I get started?">
    Visit the [Getting Started
    Guide](https://www.docubook.pro/docs/getting-started) to learn more.
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

### 2. **Tabs**

Tabs allow you to display different pieces of information in a compact space, making it easier for users to switch between related content.

#### Example:

```mdx
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Overview">
    DocuBook simplifies documentation creation with interactive components.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Features">
    - Interactive elements - Customizable themes - Markdown and MDX support
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
```

### 3. **Callout**

Highlight important information or tips using the Callout component. Itâ€™s an effective way to draw attention to key details.

#### Example:

```mdx
<Callout type="info">
  Remember to save your changes frequently to avoid losing progress.
</Callout>
```

### 4. **Code Block with Syntax Highlighting**

DocuBook supports code blocks with syntax highlighting, making it easier to showcase code snippets in various programming languages.

#### Example:

````mdx
```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
console.log(greet("DocuBook"));
```
````

````

### 5. **Table**

Tables are a great way to present structured data in an organized format.

#### Example:
```mdx
<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Feature</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Description</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Interactive Components</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Enhance user engagement with dynamic elements.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Custom Themes</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Align documentation design with your brand.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>
````

### 6. **Alert**

Use the Alert component to notify users about warnings, errors, or important updates.

#### Example:

```mdx
<Alert type="warning">
  This feature is currently in beta. Use with caution.
</Alert>
```
