Setting up DocuBook is straightforward, with options to clone the repository or use the convenient `npx` command. DocuBook requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18 or higher for optimal performance.

## Clone Repository

To get started, you can clone the DocuBook repository directly from GitHub.

## Quick Setup with npx

For a faster setup, use the `npx` command to create a new DocuBook project in one step:

```bash
npx create_docu
```

**Command Output:**

```bash
? Enter a name for your project directory: (docubook)

Creating a new Docubook project in /Users/wildan/docubook from the main branch...

Next steps:
1. Navigate to your project directory:
   cd docubook
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
3. Start the development server:

```

With this setup, you’ll have a ready-to-use DocuBook instance to start building your documentation.
