Setting up DocuBook is straightforward, with options to clone the repository or use the convenient `npx` command. DocuBook requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18 or higher for optimal performance.

## Clone Repository

To get started, you can clone the DocuBook repository directly from GitHub.

<Stepper>

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nisabmohd/Aria-Docs.git
    ```

  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 2: Access the Project Directory">
    After cloning, navigate into the project directory to start setting up:

    ```bash
    cd Aria-Docs
    ```

  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 3: Install Required Dependencies">
    Install all necessary project dependencies with npm:

    ```

  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 4: Launch the Development Server">

    ```

  </StepperItem>

## Quick Setup with npx

For a faster setup, use the `npx` command to create a new DocuBook project in one step:

```bash
npx create-aria-doc <project-directory>
```

**Command Output:**

```bash
Creating a new DocuBook project in /path/to/your/project from the master branch...
Cloning Master (Full Documentation)...
DocuBook project successfully created in /path/to/your/project!

Next steps:
1. Navigate to your project directory:
   cd <project-directory>
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
3. Start the development server:
   npm run dev
```

With this setup, youâ€™ll have a ready-to-use DocuBook instance to start building your documentation.
